# Anki circular progress add-on

This is a simple Anki add-on that displays a circular progress overlay.

## Motivation

Studying for hours can feel overwhelming, especially when you lose track of where you are. That uncertainty can make us feel we studied a lot when in fact only a few minutes have passed. Seeing your progress graphically _may_ address that and help you study throughout.
